# # EGH320 - Mechatronics Design II: Orange Soil on the Moon
## Project Summary
This project integrated appliations of advanced mechanics, electronics and embedded software principles to complete a real world problem in a mock lunar environment.
The team was tasked with navigating a robot through a replica environment in search of certain objects while avoiding others.
The robot used a live camera feed and computer vision to detect objects and then applied decision making algorithms to control the robots movement towards or away from these objects.
A report outlining the entire project can be seen in _EGB320 Final Report.pdf_.
